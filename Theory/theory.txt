Q: How to look for bugs in plain js?
Ans: By executing it.
    If you want to look for bugs while development, use TYPESCRIPT. The goal of typescript is to help
    catching errors while development.


* install typescript to the system globally (one time setup)
    - npm i -g typescript ts-node
    * installing typescript gives you the access to command tsc(typescript compiler)
    * tsc is to compile typescript code to js code
    * run tsc --help command to check if typescript is installed correctly

* Running the typescript code
    - you can not run typescript code on the browser directly. you first have to compile the typescript
    file into js file then it'll be able to run over the browser.
    - There are two ways of doing this:
        1. Compile the typescript file into js file using "tsc [filename with ts extension]". It will generate
        files in js extension that will be executable by using command "node [filename with js extension]".
        2. Directly run the command "ts-node [filename with ts extension]". It will serve itself compile
        and execute the ts file.
