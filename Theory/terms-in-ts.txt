* Interface:
    Interface in ts are used to define the structure of an object.

* Type Annotation vs Type Inference:
    - Type Annotation: Code we add to tell typescript what type of value a variable refer to. (We developers tell 
    typescript the type).
    - Type Inference: Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to. (Typescript guesses the 
    type).
